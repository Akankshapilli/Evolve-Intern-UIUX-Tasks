  Research:
    For a coffee app, the sign-up page should not only be user-friendly but also visually appealing,
    potentially incorporating coffee-themed graphics or elements to create a unique and engaging experience for coffee lovers.
      1.Simplified Onboarding:
        - Start with minimal information, such as name, email, and password.
      2.Clear Call-to-Action:
        - Use a prominent "Get Started" or "Sign Up" button to initiate the registration process.
      3.Social Media Sign-up:
        - Include options to sign up with Facebook or Google accounts for user convenience.
      4.User-Friendly Forms:
        - Design clean and visually appealing forms with input labels, placeholders, and inline validation.
      5.Password Creation:
        - Clearly communicate password requirements to ensure the security of user accounts.
      6.Personalization:
        - After basic sign-up, prompt users to set their coffee preferences, such as roast level, flavor profile, and brewing method.

        - Use a progress bar or step indicators to show users how far they are in the registration process.
      10.Privacy and Terms:
        - Provide links to the app's privacy policy and terms of service for users to review.
      11.Success and Onboarding:
        - Celebrate a successful sign-up with a welcoming message and offer a brief onboarding tutorial to introduce users to the app's features.
